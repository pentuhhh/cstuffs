File processing for Data
    it is bad. why is it bad?
        duplication of Data
        lack of centralized control
        programmers need to make their own file format
        expensive to maintain

    all of these will result in data dependency

    Datadependency is so bad because programmers for each app
    must maintain their own data, which leads to duplicates and 
    inconsistency.

    programmers will have to expend the extra effort to develop its own
    metadata, processing routines for manipulating data. there will be 
    some sort also in difficulty for managing and coordinating data and the
    custom file formats will inevitably create incompatibility issues

    Solution? ise a database management system to maintain and provide access 
    to user data, and essentially eliminating data dependency, data redundancy
    providing program data independence and having a structured control system
    for users and administrators

    elements in a database
        Entities are objects; noun
        Relationships are a result of entities interacting with each other or itself

        relational databases are complex relationships involving tables of entities
        rather than a singular one
