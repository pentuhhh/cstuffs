    "$\\textbf{Common Mistakes in Creating Proofs}$\n",
    "-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arguing from Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Looking at examples is one of the most helpful practices a problem solver can engage in and is encouraged by all good mathematics teachers, this is not considered as a formal proof.\n",
    "- Examples cannot be generalized and should be considered as special cases.\n",
    "- There might be a possibility that a counterexample might exist.\n",
    "- A universal statement may be true in many instances without being true in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If you answer to the exercise that the sum of any two integer is also an even integer is similar to\n",
    "Let $m = 14$, which is even, and let $n = 6$ which is also even then the sum of m and n, which is $m+n = 20$, which is even. This might sound convincing and support a true conclusion but it is not a generalize solution, but a spciale case of using the integer 14 and 6 to end up with 22.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the same letter to mean two different things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is a noob mistake, sometimes begginers would often give a new variable the same letter as the previously introduced variable, which is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If your answer is similar to, by definition of an even integer $m = 2k$ and $n = 2k$, you are stating that m and n are equal since $m = 2k = n$, s.t. $m+n = (2k) + (2k) = 4k$. The result is not a definition of an even integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Jumping into conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alleging the truth without providing adequate reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If your answer is similar to suppose $m$ and $n$ are even integer. By definition of even, $m = 2r$ and $n=2s$, for some integer r and s. Then $m+n = 2r+2s$ is even. This proof is wrong, the problem with this proof is that it lacks the definition of an even integer that is $m+n = 2r+2s = 2(r+s)$, let $(r+s) = \\beta$, and let $m+n = \\alpha$ then $\\beta=2 \\alpha$ which is a definition of an even number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Circular Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are assuming what is to be proved, this is a variation of jumping into conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: if your answer is similar to suppose m and n are any even integers, then by definition, their sum is also even. Why is this not a valid proof?\n",

    "\n",
    "- When noobs tend to overcomplicate things. This occurs when.\n",

    "6. Misuse of any and some.\n",
