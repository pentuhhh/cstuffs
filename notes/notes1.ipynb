    "    - a function can receive an array. My preference is to declare a function that accepts a pointer\n",
    "\n",
    "    example would be \"void swap(int *a, int *b); this function can accept either a pointer to a variable OR\n",
    "    it may accept a specific element of an array\n",

    "    lets say we have an array = {1,2,3}, we want to swap index 0 and index 2 (numbers 1 and 3 respectively), we may use\n",

    "    2. Dynamic allocation and deallocation\n",
    "\n",
    "    - suppose we have a function, get array. this function will continuosly ask the user to input a number and it will combine all\n",
    "    the inputs into an array. How do we go about this?\n",
    "\n",
    "    first we may initialize the function\n",

    "    ** The problem is that functions will delete its contents, variables and pointers, once it is completed. How do we counter\n",
    "    this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    we have to allocate space in the memory for our array.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let us use malloc\n",
    "\n",
    "    its syntax is \"datatype * name = (datatype *) malloc (length * sizeof(datatype));\n",
    "    since our getArray function will create a integer array, we will malloc a new array inside the func. defn\n",

    "    in this, the malloc function will create a block of memory, of a fixed size. its size is determined in bytes\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    *myarray will point to a location in the memory where 20bytes is allocated.\n",
