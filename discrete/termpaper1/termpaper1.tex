\section{Introduction}

\hspace{0.5cm} In this paper we will explore and expound through ,mathematical proofing, several fundamental
 theorems and inequalities in Discrete Math. These proving challenges will task us to revisit and refine our basic understanding of Algebra, Number Theory and most of all writing proofs.

\vspace{1cm}
This paper requires the knowledge and skill of writing cohesive mathematical proofs by establishing 
a domain, hypothesis and a conclusion. Relying heavily on establishing statements that are supported by mathematical laws, theorems
%
and lemmas. Using these fundamental concepts, we are able to structure and justify our arguments or counter arguments
%
Our goal is to prove, disprove our hypothesis and possible create a better and more logically sound counter argument

\section{Euler's Number Proof}

Task: Prove that e, Euler's number is not a rational number

e = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!} \notin \mathbb{Q}

Recalling the definition of a rational number, denoted as $\mathbb{Q}$,

\vspace{0.5cm}
{\fontsize{17.28}{18pt}\selectfont
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \mathbb{Q}
\]

Let us create a hypothesis, assume that euler's number is a rational number.
\newline

hypothesis: \centering {\fontsize{17.28}{18pt}\selectfont
\[e \in \mathbb{Q}
\]

Suppose that the summation from k = 0 to $\infty$ can be expressed in a more simpler form

\centering{\fontsize{17.28pt}{18pt}\selectfont
\[ \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!} = \frac{1}{0!} + \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} ... + \frac{1}{k!} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
}

\centering{\fontsize{17.28pt}{18pt}\selectfont
\[ e = \frac{a}{b}
\]
